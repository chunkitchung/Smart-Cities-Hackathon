# Smart-Cities-Hackathon
This is a Smart Self-Checkout System for the 2023 Smart Cities Seneca Hackathon. The Smart Self-Checkout System utilizes Tensor Flow framework for image recognition and Fire-store Real-time Database to optimize the shopping experience. Our system can identify the goods in a shopping cart and allows customers to walk out of the store without having to interact with the typical self-checkout system.
